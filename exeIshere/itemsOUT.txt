The key
quest items
grants its wielder a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist illusion effects, as well as on charisma checks made in the Dimension of Dreams. But the key imposes a –2 penalty on saving throws against sleep effects, and its holder is considered to have 2 fewer Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the number of Hit Dice used in sleep effects and the number of creatures affected. The key’s holder is always counted first when determining which creatures are affected.
