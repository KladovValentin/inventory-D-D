The key
quest items
grants its wielder a +4 bonus on
saving throws to resist illusion effects, as well as on
Charisma checks made in the Dimension of Dreams. But
the key imposes a –2 penalty on saving throws against
sleep effects, and its holder is considered to have
2 fewer Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the
number of Hit Dice used in sleep effects and the number
of creatures affected. The key’s holder is always counted
first when determining which creatures are affected.
